class LeagueDashPlayerStats:
    """
    Represents the league-wide player statistics for a given season.

    This class provides methods to create the `leaguedashplayerstats` table,
    add records to it, and fetch all stats with optional filters.

    Methods:
        create_table(): Creates the `leaguedashplayerstats` table in the
        database.
        add_stat(**kwargs): Adds a new record to the table.
        get_all_stats(filters=None): Retrieves all stats with optional
        filtering.

    Usage:
        LeagueDashPlayerStats.create_table()
        LeagueDashPlayerStats.add_stat(
            player_id=1, player_name='John Doe', ...)
        stats = LeagueDashPlayerStats.get_all_stats(filters={
